    <p className="mb-30">
      One of the fundamental principles of UCD is gaining a deep understanding
      of user needs through research and observation. By conducting user
      interviews, surveys, and usability tests, designers can uncover valuable
      insights into user behaviors, pain points, and motivations.
    </p>
    <h3 className="mb-25">Fostering Collaboration and Empathy</h3>
    <p>
      UCD fosters a culture of collaboration and empathy within design teams, as
      well as with stakeholders and end-users. By involving stakeholders and
      end-users throughout the design process, designers can build consensus,
      gain valuable feedback, and create products that truly meet user needs.
      This collaborative approach leads to better-designed products.
    </p>

      In conclusion, user-centered design is not just a methodology; it&apos;s a
      mindset that places users at the heart of the design process.
