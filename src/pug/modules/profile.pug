				p(class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed") I am a strong advocate for leveraging AI-powered tools and use them 100% throughout both my design and development workflows. In design, AI assists me in generating concepts, optimizing layouts, creating design systems, and refining UX patterns. In development, AI accelerates code generation, automates repetitive tasks, improves code quality through intelligent suggestions, and streamlines documentation processes. This comprehensive AI integration allows me to focus on complex problem-solving, architectural decisions, and delivering higher-value solutions while maintaining the highest standards of quality and best practices. My proficiency with AI tools has significantly increased my output velocity across the entire project lifecycle without compromising on the precision and excellence that define my work.
